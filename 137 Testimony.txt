The witness of the Holy Ghost,
As borne by those who know,
Has lifted me again to thee,
O Father of my soul. ###
I know that thou art in the heav’n.
I know the Savior reigns.
I know a prophet speaks to us
For our eternal gain. ###
My eyes are wet; my heart is full.
The Spirit speaks today.
O Lord, wilt thou my life renew
And in my bosom stay. ###
As testimony fills my heart,
It dulls the pain of days.
For one brief moment, heaven’s view
Appears before my gaze. ###
