An open door, a warm embrace
Call us to worship and share God’s grace.
All can gather safely here,
Partake of emblems, feel Jesus near.
As weary trav’lers on life’s road,
When the world is dark and cold,
Where’er we wander, where’er we roam,
We’re always welcome, welcome home. ###
The temple doors invite each guest
To feel God’s presence and in Him rest.
Humble souls at altars kneel,
Make cov’nants sweet, bring hearts to heal.
As weary trav’lers on life’s road,
When the world is dark and cold,
Where’er we wander, where’er we roam,
We’re always welcome, welcome home. ###
 The gates of heaven blaze with light.
The Savior beckons in robes of white—
Arms outstretched, His table spread.
Come to His feast; with love be fed.
As weary trav’lers on life’s road,
When the world is dark and cold,
Where’er we wander, where’er we roam,
We’re always welcome, welcome home. ###
