When the Savior comes again, He will cleanse the earth, and then
In glory He will reign as King of kings among all men.
Hate will cease and war will end; peace will dwell throughout the land;
The wolf shall feed together with the lamb. ###
Lift up your voice! Rejoice! And prepare for that day!
Learn of the Lord and keep following His way.
No one knows the day and hour when He will come again,
But He’ll return as scriptures say; it will be a joyful day
When our beloved Savior comes again. ####
When that glorious day is here, there will be no need to fear;
For Satan will be bound, and Christ will reign a thousand years.
Death and pain will be no more; hidden knowledge shall come forth
And ev’ry tongue confess that Christ is Lord! ###
Lift up your voice! Rejoice! And prepare for that day!
Learn of the Lord and keep following His way.
No one knows the day and hour when He will come again,
But He’ll return as scriptures say; it will be a joyful day
When our beloved Savior comes again. ###
