Why should I feel discouraged?
Why should the shadows come?
Why should my heart be lonely
And long for heav’n and home,
When Jesus is my portion?
My constant Friend is He:
His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me; ###
His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.
I sing because I’m happy—
I sing because I’m free— ###
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.
“Let not your heart be troubled.”
His tender word I hear,
And resting on His goodness,
I lose my doubt and fear.
Though by the path He leadeth,
But one step I may see:
His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me. ###
I sing because I’m happy—
I sing because I’m free—
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me. ###
Whenever I am tempted,
Whenever clouds arise,
When songs give place to sighing,
When hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to Him;
From care He sets me free:
His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me. ###
I sing because I’m happy—
I sing because I’m free—
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me. ###
