Gentle peace warms my soul
When the Sabbath comes once again.
I can worship and renew
Sacred covenants with Him.
On this day of peace and rest,
I will give the Lord my best.
And His love will light my way
As I keep the Sabbath day. ###
As I pray, serve, and sing,
I give gratitude to the Lord,
Humbly take the sacrament,
Gladly hear His holy word.
On this day of peace and rest,
I will give the Lord my best.
And His love will light my way
As I keep the Sabbath day. ###
Through this day, I will live
That His Spirit may come and stay—
Make the Sabbath a delight,
Precious gift, the Lord’s own day.
On this day of peace and rest,
I will give the Lord my best.
And His love will light my way
As I keep the Sabbath day. ###
