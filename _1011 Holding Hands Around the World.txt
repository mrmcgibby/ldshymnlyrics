We are children singing all around the world,
Happy voices ringing out the joyful word.
We are children glowing with the gospel light,
Standing tall, walking strong, choosing right.
We are children leading out in ev’ry land
Who believe in keeping all the Lord’s commands.
Like the stripling warriors we go forth in faith,
For we know that the Lord is our strength. ###
We are children holding hands around the world,
Like an army with the gospel flag unfurled.
We are led by His light,
And we love truth and right.
We are building the kingdom of God. ###
We are children sharing all around the world,
Leading other children to the gospel fold.
With the strength of youth, we do the Savior’s work.
With our hearts and our hands we will serve.
We are cov’nant children with a gift to give.
We will teach the gospel by the way we live.
With each word and action, we will testify:
We believe, and we serve Jesus Christ. ###
We are children holding hands around the world,
Like an army with the gospel flag unfurled.
We are led by His light,
And we love truth and right.
We are building the kingdom of God. ###
