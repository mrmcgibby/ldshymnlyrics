Oh say, can you see, by
the dawn’s early light,
What so proudly we hailed
at the twilight’s last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright
stars, through the perilous fight,
O’er the ramparts we watched,
were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets’ red glare,
the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thru the night
that our flag was still there.
Oh say, does that star-
spangled banner yet wave
O’er the land of the free
and the home of the brave? ###
On the shore, dimly seen
thru the mists of the deep,
Where the foe’s haughty host
in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the
breeze, o’er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half
conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam
of the morning’s first beam,
In full glory reflected
now shines on the stream;
’Tis the star-spangled banner!
Oh, long may it wave
O’er the land of the free and
the home of the brave! ###
Oh, thus be it ever, when
free men shall stand
Between their loved homes
and the war’s desolation!
Blest with vict’ry and peace,
may the heav’n-rescued land
Praise the Pow’r that hath
made and preserved us a nation!
Then conquer we must,
when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto:
“In God is our trust!”
And the star-spangled banner
in triumph shall wave
O’er the land of the free
and the home of the brave! ###
