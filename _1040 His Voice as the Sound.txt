His voice as the sound of the dulcimer sweet
Is heard through the shadow of death.
The cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet;
The air is perfumed with His breath.
His words like a fountain of righteousness flow
That waters the garden of grace.
The source of salvation all people shall know
And bask in the smile of His face. ###
The robes of His righteousness— who can describe?
Their purity words would defile.
The heav’ns to His presence their beauties ascribe,
And earth is made rich by His smile.
The warmth of His mercy in excellence bright
Shines down from His kingdom above.
Like morning, He fills all creation with light
And comforts His people with love. ###
He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,
And myriads wait for His word.
He speaks, and eternity, filled with His voice,
Reechoes the praise of the Lord.
Dear Shepherd, I hear and will follow Thy call;
I know the sweet sound of Thy voice.
Restore and protect me, for Thou art my All;
In Thee I will ever rejoice. ###
