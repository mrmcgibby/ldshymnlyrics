O Lord, who gave Thy life for me,
I come now in humility
And here my sacrifice impart:
A contrite soul, a broken heart.
Oh, may Thy love in mercy shine
And bind my sorrowing heart to Thine. ###
My burden at Thy feet I lay—
My pride, my hurt, each willful way,
The weight of all my sin and care—
And in its place Thy yoke I’ll bear.
Oh, may Thy love my soul refine
And bind my trusting heart to Thine. ###
My heart is full of love for Thee,
Because I know Thou first loved me.
Now by that love I’ll seek to live;
Like Thee, I freely would forgive.
Oh, may Thy love my life define
And bind my willing heart to Thine. ###
And as I strive to thus endure
With cleaner hands and heart more pure,
In all around I see Thy face
And feel the bounties of Thy grace.
O Savior, may Thy love divine
Now bind my grateful heart to Thine. ###
