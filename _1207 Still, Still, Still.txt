Still, still, still—
Jesus sleeps and all is still.
His mother, Mary, gently holds Him,
Softly in her arms enfolds Him.
Still, still, still—
Jesus sleeps and all is still. ###
Sleep, sleep, sleep—
See the blessed Baby sleep
While heav’nly choirs in jubilation
Sing God’s praise through all creation.
Sleep, sleep, sleep—
See the blessed Baby sleep. ###
Love, love, love—
Oh, how great the Father’s love!
He sent His Son, so meek and lowly,
That through Him we may be holy.
Love, love, love—
Oh, how great the Father’s love! ###
