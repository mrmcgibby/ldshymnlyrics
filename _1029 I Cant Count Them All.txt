The Lord’s loving mercies surround me—
So many, I can’t count them all.
Like dewdrops, they sparkle around me;
Like treasures from heaven they fall.
The Lord’s loving mercies surround me—
So many, I can’t count them all. ###
Like stars without number above me,
His mercies shine bright through the years.
These blessings from One who so loves me
Dispel the world’s darkness and fears.
Like stars without number above me,
His mercies shine bright through the years. ###
The Lord’s loving gifts are unceasing,
And thanks evermore will I give.
My gratitude, ever increasing,
I’ll offer as long as I live.
The Lord’s loving gifts are unceasing,
And thanks evermore will I give. ###
