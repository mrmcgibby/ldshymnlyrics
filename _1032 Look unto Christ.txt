When shadows veil your wond’ring mind,
Doubt not.
For all who seek will surely find.
Doubt not.
One day you’ll see in glory bright
The Lord, who led you through the night.
Look unto Christ; receive His light.
Doubt not. ###
Though floods may rise and foes conspire,
Fear not.
In blinding gale or circling fire,
Fear not.
Look to your Lord, for He is there
With wondrous pow’r and tender care.
Go forth in faith; reach out in prayer.
Fear not. ###
When worldly voices mock and scorn,
Heed not.
Through tribulation, strength is born.
Heed not.
Our Father’s love—the sweetest prize—
Exceeds the wisdom of the wise.
Look unto Christ, though foes despise.
Heed not. ###
O souls who strive, O hearts that mourn:
Press on.
Your path may lead through briar and thorn.
Press on.
Someday with joy you shall ascend
And kneel before your Lord and Friend.
He walks beside you to the end.
Press on. ###
