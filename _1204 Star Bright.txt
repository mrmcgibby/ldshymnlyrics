The heavens with light o’erflowing
A story of love will tell.
A new star will shine in glory
When Jesus comes on earth to dwell. ###
O star bright, the world is pining
For you to turn night into the day.
O star bright in heaven shining,
Come, glow within me on Christmas Day. ###
Be joyful with eyes upturning,
Beholding the time at hand.
The night sign will soon be burning;
He’s coming to our promised land. ###
O star bright, the world is pining
For you to turn night into the day.
O star bright in heaven shining,
Come, glow within me on Christmas Day. ###
Our Father with love is sending
The Christ child to conquer strife.
His mercy to all extending,
He’s bringing everlasting life. ###
O star bright, the world is pining
For you to turn night into the day.
O star bright in heaven shining,
Come, glow within me on Christmas Day. ###
