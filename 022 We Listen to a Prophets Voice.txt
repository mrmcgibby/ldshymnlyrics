We listen to a prophet’s voice
and hear the Savior too.
With love he bids us do the work
the Lord would have us do.
The Savior calls his chosen seer
to preach the word of God,
That men might learn to find the
path marked by the iron rod. ###
In ev’ry land, in ev’ry tongue,
our prophet will be heard;
How swiftly round the world his
voice reveals the gospel word!
The sacred message that he brings
will witness and agree
With ev’ry prophet called of God
throughout earth’s history. ###
Hosanna! Let our praise ascend
unto the Savior’s throne;
Rejoice! The prophet has confirmed
that by Him we are known.
Attend, ye earth! The prophet
speaks; come listen and obey.
He is the man who holds the keys
of priesthood pow’r today. ###
