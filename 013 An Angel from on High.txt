An angel from on high
The long, long silence broke;
Descending from the sky,
These gracious words he spoke:
Lo! in Cumorah’s lonely hill
A sacred record lies concealed.
- Lo! in Cumorah’s lonely hill
A sacred record lies concealed. ###
Sealed by Moroni’s hand,
It has for ages lain
To wait the Lord’s command,
From dust to speak again.
It shall again to light come forth
To usher in Christ’s reign on earth.
- It shall again to light come forth
To usher in Christ’s reign on earth. ###
It speaks of Joseph’s seed
And makes the remnant known
Of nations long since dead,
Who once had dwelt alone.
The fulness of the gospel, too,
Its pages will reveal to view.
- The fulness of the gospel, too,
Its pages will reveal to view. ###
The time is now fulfilled,
The long-expected day;
Let earth obedience yield
And darkness flee away.
Remove the seals; be wide unfurled
Its light and glory to the world.
- Remove the seals; be wide unfurled
Its light and glory to the world. ###
Lo! Israel filled with joy
Shall now be gathered home,
Their wealth and means employ
To build Jerusalem,
While Zion shall arise and shine
And fill the earth with truth divine.
- While Zion shall arise and shine
And fill the earth with truth divine. ###
