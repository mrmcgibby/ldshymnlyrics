Because He walked the path, I know the way.
Because He calmed the storm, I’m not afraid.
Because He made the lame to walk and caused the blind to see
And blessed the children one by one, I feel His love for me.
And I will praise forever
The Savior of the world,
And I will sing together
With all the Saints on earth.
Because He gave to me ev’rything
He had to give,
I breathe, I see, I hope, I love, I live. ###
Because He died for me, I’ll live again.
Because He is my Friend, I’ll follow Him.
Because He fills the world with light, I’m filled with hope and peace.
And when He comes to earth again, I’ll kneel before His feet.
And I will praise forever
The Savior of the world,
And I will sing together
With all the Saints on earth.
Because He gave to me ev’rything
He had to give,
I breathe, I see, I hope, I love, I live. ###
