Come, hear the word the Lord has spoken,
Revealed anew in latter days.
The heav’ns again to us are open;
Let all rejoice and sing His praise! ###
The Savior will redeem His people,
And Satan’s work will be undone.
The truths of God to earth from heaven
Will all be gathered into one. ###
The Lord’s great day is surely coming.
We long to see that blessed day
When Christ will reign with peace and justice
And He will wipe all tears away. ###
The mountains then will shout, rejoicing,
For Christ will reign on earth as King!
His holy word will stand forever.
Let ev’ry soul give thanks and sing! ###
