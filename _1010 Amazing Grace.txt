Amazing grace—how sweet the sound—
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see. ###
The Lord has promised good to me;
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures. ###
Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come.
His grace has brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home. ###
