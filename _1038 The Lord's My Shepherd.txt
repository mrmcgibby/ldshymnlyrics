The Lord’s my shepherd; I’ll not want.
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green;
He leadeth me The quiet waters by.
He leadeth me, He leadeth me
The quiet waters by. ###
My soul He doth restore again
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness,
E’en for His own name’s sake;
Within the paths of righteousness,
E’en for His own name’s sake. ###
Yea, though I walk in death’s dark vale,
Yet will I fear no ill;
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still;
For Thou art with me, and
Thy rod And staff me comfort still. ###
My table Thou hast furnished
In presence of my foes;
My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
And my cup overflows.
My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
And my cup overflows. ###
Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me,
And in God’s house forevermore
My dwelling place shall be;
And in God’s house forevermore
My dwelling place shall be. ###
