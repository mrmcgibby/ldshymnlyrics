Jesus climbed the hill to the Garden still;
His steps were heavy and slow.
Love and a prayer took Him there
to the place only He could go. ###
Gethsemane! Jesus loves me,
So He went willingly to Gethsemane. ###
He felt all that was sad, wicked, or bad,
all the pain we would ever know.
While His friends were asleep, He
fought to keep His promise made long ago. ###
Gethsemane! Jesus loves me,
So He went willingly to Gethsemane. ###
The hardest thing that ever was done,
The greatest pain that ever was known,
The biggest battle that ever was wonâ€”
This was done by Jesus!
The fight was won by Jesus! ###
Gethsemane! Jesus loves me,
So He gave this gift to me in Gethsemane.
Gethsemane! Jesus loves me,
So He gives this gift to me from Gethsemane. ###
