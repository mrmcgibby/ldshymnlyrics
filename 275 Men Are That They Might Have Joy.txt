A voice hath spoken from the dust,
Its message pure, without alloy,
Of treasured hope and sacred trust:
Oh, “men are that they might have joy.” ###
Should sorrow come, we’ll not despair,
For He would not that men should pine.
The grief that comes we’ll learn to bear
Until again the sun doth shine. ###
Before the Lord, then, humbly go.
His message will our spirits buoy.
On us his blessings he’ll bestow,
For “men are that they might have joy.” ###
