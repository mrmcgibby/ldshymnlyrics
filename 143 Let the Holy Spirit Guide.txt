Let the Holy Spirit guide;
Let him teach us what is true.
He will testify of Christ,
Light our minds with heaven’s view. ###
Let the Holy Spirit guard;
Let his whisper govern choice.
He will lead us safely home
If we listen to his voice. ###
Let the Spirit heal our hearts
Thru his quiet, gentle pow’r.
May we purify our lives
To receive him hour by hour. ###
