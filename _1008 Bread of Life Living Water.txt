In the Garden, Jesus suffered
Ev’ry sin and ev’ry woe—
Bleeding drops from ev’ry pore,
That we might forgiveness know. ###
Bread of Life, Living Water,
Feed my soul, fill my heart.
Lord, give me new life in Thee
And make me whole—complete and holy—
Bound to Thee eternally. ###
Jesus sacrificed His body
On the cross in bitter pain—
Freely gave His life for us
So that we would live again. ###
Bread of Life, Living Water,
Feed my soul, fill my heart.
Lord, give me new life in Thee
And make me whole—complete and holy—
Bound to Thee eternally. ###
Now I come before the altar,
Off’ring Him my broken heart,
Seeking for the precious gifts
His Atonement can impart. ###
Bread of Life, Living Water,
Feed my soul, fill my heart.
Lord, give me new life in Thee
And make me whole—complete and holy—
Bound to Thee eternally. ###
