Enters now the highest heav’n. Alleluia! ###
There for Him high triumph waits. Alleluia!
Lift your heads, eternal gates. Alleluia!
He has conquered death and sin; Alleluia!
Take the King of Glory in. Alleluia! ###
See, He lifts His hands above! Alleluia!
See, He shows the prints of love! Alleluia!
Hark! His gracious gifts bestow, Alleluia!
Blessings on His Church below. Alleluia! ###
Lord, beyond our mortal sight, Alleluia!
Raise our hearts to reach Thy height. Alleluia!
There Thy face unclouded see, Alleluia!
Find our heav’n of heav’ns in Thee. Alleluia! ###
