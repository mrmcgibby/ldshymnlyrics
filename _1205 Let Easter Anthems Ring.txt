Rise up, ye Saints, rejoice!
Let Easter anthems ring!
With all who love Him, lift your voice
In praise of Christ, our King.
For Jesus came to save
And break the chains of sin.
He conquered sorrow and the grave
And new life ushered in. ###
Lo, how the cross stood bare,
How empty lay the tomb,
When Easter, dawning bright and fair,
Dispelled the pall of gloom.
For Jesus vanquished death,
And all will be restored
When ev’ry soul draws living breath
Through Christ, the risen Lord. ###
Blessing us evermore
By His atoning pow’r,
Our Lord, who sin and sorrows bore,
Sustains us hour by hour.
Our tears He’ll gently dry
When we behold His face.
Sing praise to Christ, who reigns on high,
Our King of love and grace! ###
