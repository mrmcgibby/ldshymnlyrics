Moment by moment, by night or by day,
My Heavenly Father is not far away.
And He will be near when I whisper His name.
He is close as a quiet prayer,
Close as a quiet prayer. ###
When I am thankful for blessings He sends,
He smiles as I offer my praises to Him.
And when I’m alone and in need of a friend,
He is close as a quiet prayer,
Close as a quiet prayer.
I can pray to my Father above anytime, anywhere.
When I call, He will always be
Close as a quiet prayer. ###
Whether I’m kneeling to seek Him with words,
Or silently praying, my heart will be heard.
His love will enfold me; His promise is sure.
He is close as a quiet prayer,
Close as a quiet prayer. ###
