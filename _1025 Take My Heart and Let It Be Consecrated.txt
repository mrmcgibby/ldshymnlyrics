Take my heart, and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee.
Take my moments and my days;
Let them flow in ceaseless praise,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise. ###
Take my hands, and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love.
Take my feet, and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee,
Swift and beautiful for Thee. ###
Take my voice and let me sing
Always, only, for my King.
Take my lips, and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee,
Filled with messages from Thee. ###
Take my will and make it Thine;
It shall be no longer mine.
Take my heartâ€”it is Thine own;
It shall be Thy royal throne,
It shall be Thy royal throne. ###
