My Shepherd will supply my need;
Jehovah is His name.
In pastures fresh He makes me feed
Beside the living stream.
He brings my wand’ring spirit back
When I forsake His ways
And leads me for His mercy’s sake
In paths of truth and grace. ###
When I walk through the shades of death,
Thy presence is my stay;
One word of Thy supporting breath
Drives all my fears away.
Thy hand, in sight of all my foes,
Doth still my table spread.
My cup with blessings overflows;
Thine oil anoints my head. ###
The sure provisions of my God
Attend me all my days.
O may Thy house be mine abode
And all my work be praise!
There would I find a settled rest
While others go and come—
No more a stranger nor a guest,
But like a child at home. ###
