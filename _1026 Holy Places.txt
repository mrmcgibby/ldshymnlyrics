The temple is a holy place
Where heaven touches earth—
A rev’rent place, a hallowed space,
Where we do the Savior’s work.
I’ll stand in holy places
With a heart that’s firm and true,
Until Christ returns and makes all the world Holy, clean, and new. ###
A home can be a holy place
To learn of God above—
A prayerful place to seek His face,
Where we grow in faith and love.
I’ll stand in holy places
With a heart that’s firm and true,
Until Christ returns and makes all the world Holy, clean, and new. ###
My heart can be a holy place
When all around is dim—
A peaceful place of hope and grace,
Where the Spirit shines within.
I’ll stand in holy places
With a heart that’s firm and true,
Until Christ returns and makes all the world Holy, clean, and new. ###
