A marvelous work has begun to come forth
Among all the children of men.
O ye that embark in the service of God,
Give heart, mind, and strength unto Him;
For prophets have spoken and angels have come
To lift the world from sin,
That Christ may reign over all the earth
And bless His gathered kin.
With faith in ev’ry footstep,
We follow Christ, the Lord;
And filled with hope through His pure love,
We sing with one accord. ###
Those marvelous Saints who embraced this great work
And shared it in lands far and near—
Who gave all their heart, mind, and strength to the Lord
With wisdom and vision so clear—
Now stand as examples of virtue and faith,
Of souls prepared to hear,
Of knowledge sure, born of humble heart,
And love that banished fear.
With faith in ev’ry footstep,
We follow Christ, the Lord;
And filled with hope through His pure love,
We sing with one accord. ###
If we now desire to assist in this work
And thrust in our sickle with might,
If we will embark in the service of God
To harvest in fields that are white,
Our souls may receive the salvation of God—
The fulness of His light—
Then we may stand, free of sin and blame,
God’s glory in our sight.
With faith in ev’ry footstep,
We follow Christ, the Lord;
And filled with hope through His pure love,
We sing with one accord. ###
