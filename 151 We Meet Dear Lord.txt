We meet, dear Lord, in meekness all,
Responding to thy Sabbath call
To gather here in thy blest name,
And pledge our faithfulness again. ###
Thy counsels true we love to hear,
And feel thy Spirit’s presence near,
As we with friends our voices raise
In prayer and songs of joyous praise. ###
In oneness and in love we come
Once more to this our Sabbath home,
Rejoicing in thy welcome here,
Unto this place of peace and prayer. ###
