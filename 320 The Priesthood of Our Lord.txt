Brethren, pow’r by earthly standards
Comes by rank or wealth or sword;
But the pow’r above all others
Is the priesthood of our Lord. ###
It is ours, the total armor—
Priesthood held by Christ, our Lord—
If, as brethren, we are worthy
Of the Spirit’s whispered word. ###
Let us venture forth in freedom
With the priesthood as our guide—
Deacons, teachers, priests, and elders,
Seeking virtue side by side. ###
