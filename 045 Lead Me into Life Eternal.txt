Lead me into life eternal
By the gospel’s holy call.
Let thy promise rest upon me;
Grant me ready strength for all. ###
Father, all my heart I give thee;
All my service shall be thine.
Guide me as I search in weakness;
Let thy loving light be mine. ###
Hear me as I pray in meekness;
Let my strength be as thy day.
Give me faith, the greater knowledge;
Father, bless me as I pray. ###
