Oh, how great is our joy ev’ry day
As we serve in the work of our Lord.
What an honor to walk in His way
As we share Jesus’ light and His word.
Share His light, share His light, share His light, share His light—
Oh, how great is our joy ev’ry day, ev’ry day.
Share His light, share His light, share His light, share His light—
As we serve in this glorious way. ###
Hear the word of the Lord unto all.
Teach with gladness His truths from above.
Oh, remember and always recall
Jesus’ goodness, His grace, and His love.
Share His love, share His love, share His love, share His love—
Hear the word of the Lord unto all, unto all.
Share His love, share His love, share His love, share His love—
As you faithfully honor your call. ###
Oh, dear brothers and sisters, rejoice,
For the time of our labors has come.
Let us lift up our hearts and our voice
Till we meet in our heavenly home.
Till we meet, till we meet,
Oh, dear brothers and sisters, rejoice.
Till we meet, till we meet,
Let us lift up our hearts and rejoice. ###
