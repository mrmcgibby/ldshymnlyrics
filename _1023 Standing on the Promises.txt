Standing on the promises of Christ, my King,
Through eternal ages let His praises ring!
Glory in the highest I will shout and sing—
Standing on the promises of God.
Standing, standing,
Standing on the promises of Christ, my Savior;
Standing, standing—
I’m standing on the promises of God. ###
Standing on the promises that cannot fail
When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail,
By the living Word of God I shall prevail—
Standing on the promises of God.
Standing, standing,
Standing on the promises of Christ, my Savior;
Standing, standing—
I’m standing on the promises of God. ###
Standing on the promises of Christ, the Lord,
Bound to Him eternally by love’s strong cord,
Overcoming daily with the Spirit’s sword—
Standing on the promises of God.
Standing, standing,
Standing on the promises of Christ, my Savior;
Standing, standing—
I’m standing on the promises of God. ###
Standing on the promises, I cannot fall,
List’ning ev’ry moment to the Spirit’s call,
Resting in my Savior as my all in all—
Standing on the promises of God.
Standing, standing,
Standing on the promises of Christ, my Savior;
Standing, standing—
I’m standing on the promises of God. ###
