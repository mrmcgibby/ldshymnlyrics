Some pioneers pulled handcarts
Or sailed the ocean blue.
When times were hard, they worked and prayed.
Their courage saw them through.
The Lord needs pioneers today;
There’s much that I can do.
I’ll work and pray and follow Him.
I’m a pioneer too! ###
They listened to the prophets,
Built homes and temples too.
They told the world of Jesus Christ.
The Savior helped them through.
The Lord needs pioneers today;
There’s much that I can do.
I’ll work and pray and follow Him.
I’m a pioneer too! ###
From Sweden to Samoa,
From Kenya to Peru,
Brave pioneers around the world
Still spread His gospel true.
The Lord needs pioneers today;
There’s much that I can do.
I’ll work and pray and follow Him.
I’m a pioneer too! ###
