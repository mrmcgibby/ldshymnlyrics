As bread is broken, we think of Thee—
Thy broken body on Calvary.
May we remember Thy suff’ring sore,
With broken hearts Thy grace implore. ###
We drink the water in memory
Of blood Thou spilt in Gethsemane.
Lord, wilt Thou wash us from ev’ry stain—
Our hearts and hands make clean again. ###
May our repentance now be sincere.
Unto our pleadings incline Thine ear.
We seek forgiveness—that gift divine—
A change of heart, a change of mind. ###
Help us, dear Savior, to take Thy name,
To be like Thee and Thy word proclaim.
Send us Thy Spirit this Sabbath day
To guide us in Thy holy way. ###
