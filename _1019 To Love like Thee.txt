Father, I pray that I might be
The answer to someoneâ€™s prayer today.
Help me, dear Lord, to love like Thee;
Grant me charity, I pray. ###
None is so small, no soul so lost
That I should withhold my charity.
When I have served the least of these,
I have done it unto Thee. ###
Bless me, O Lord, to truly see
In each soul I meet Thy child divine.
And let the image of Thy Son
In my countenance so shine. ###
Lord, I am filled with gratitude
For blessings unmeasured, grace so deep.
Help me to freely share Thy love;
Help me, Lord, to feed Thy sheep. ###
