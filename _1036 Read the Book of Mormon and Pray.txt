I want to learn to choose the right
And follow in the Savior’s light.
And I want to know the gospel’s true.
With faith in Christ, here’s something I can do:
Read the Book of Mormon and pray
Ev’ry day, ev’ry day, ev’ry day!
God will bless me with His pow’r,
Teach and guide me hour by hour
When I read the Book of Mormon and pray
Ev’ry day, ev’ry day, ev’ry day! ###
The Book of Mormon helps me see
The ways of Christ, His love for me.
When I have a question or a choice,
I read this book and listen to His voice.
Read the Book of Mormon and pray
Ev’ry day, ev’ry day, ev’ry day!
God will bless me with His pow’r,
Teach and guide me hour by hour
When I read the Book of Mormon and pray
Ev’ry day, ev’ry day, ev’ry day! ###
