Come, Lord Jesus, to the manger.
May we see Thy tender face—
Great Creator, here a stranger,
Infant in this humble place.
Darkness scatter; morning swell.
Come, dear Lord Immanuel.
Come, Lord Jesus, to the manger.
Come, Lord Jesus, come! ###
Come, Lord Jesus, to the wounded—
Broken heart and bended knee.
Worthy Lamb, Thy love unbounded,
Bid our souls to rest in Thee.
Grant us mercy, Savior, King;
Come with healing in Thy wings.
Come, Lord Jesus, to the wounded.
Come, Lord Jesus, come! ###
Come, Lord Jesus, great Redeemer,
Light of Morning, Prince of Peace.
We will be Thy children ever.
Dry our tears; may weeping cease.
Come in glory; come again.
Come to us to rule and reign.
Ready us to kneel and greet Thee.
Come, Lord Jesus, come! ###
