Behold the wounds in Jesus’ hands,
The mark upon His side,
Then ponder whom He meant to save
When on the cross He died.
We cannot see the love of God,
Which saves us from the Fall,
Yet know that Christ from wood and nails
Built mansions for us all. ###
Behold the outstretched hands of Christ—
Our Lord, who came to save—
Whose love and grace redeem our souls
And lift us from the grave.
Though we are bruised whene’er we stray,
His guiding hands caress.
He washes and anoints with oil,
And in His arms we rest. ###
Behold the wounds in Jesus’ hands.
Look to your Lord and live.
He yearns to bless you with His love
And all your sins forgive.
Oh, empty is the heart of man
When it is filled with sin.
Come, open wide your broken heart
And let your Savior in! ###
Behold His wounded hands and feet!
Come touch, and see, and feel
The wounds and marks that you may know
His love for you is real.
Then as you fall to worship Him
And wash His feet with tears,
Your Savior takes you in His arms
And quiets all your fears. ###
